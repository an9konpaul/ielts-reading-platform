                    <h2>Multi-purpose meeting spaces: Trends in 21st-century architecture</h2>
                    <p>At the Nomad Café in California, Katrina Canlas, a law student at a nearby university, places her
                        espresso next to her mobile phone, opens her laptop, logs on to the internet and begins
                        preparing for her next class. She's a regular here but doesn't usually bring cash, so her
                        credit-card statement each month reads 'Nomad, Nomad, Nomad'. That says it all, she thinks.
                        She's one of today's 'urban nomads', permanently connected and constantly moving from place to
                        place. She communicates all day by text, photo, video or voice with friends and family, and
                        amazingly does her 'work stuff' at the same time. She roams around town, but alights at oases
                        that cater to her and her fellow nomads.</p>
                    <p>Christopher Waters opened the Nomad Café in 2003 to provide a watering-hole for 'techno-Bedouins'
                        such as himself. Since Bedouins, whether in Arabian deserts or American suburbs, are tribal
                        creatures, Waters understood from the outset that a good urban oasis has to do more than provide
                        internet access; it must above all be a new — or very old — kind of gathering place. Urban
                        nomads and their lifestyles are causing architects and planners to rethink how they design
                        buildings and public spaces and even entire cities.</p>
                    <p>A prime example of this new architecture can be found in the Stata Center at the Massachusetts
                        Institute of Technology, designed by architect Frank Gehry. Gehry likes to cause a bit of
                        controversy, and the Stata Center certainly did the trick. Opened in 2004, its façade of bizarre
                        angles and windows became a Boston landmark. But the building's most radical innovation is on
                        the inside. The entire structure was conceived as a kind of 'hybrid space', with the nomadic
                        lifestyles of modern students and academic staff in mind. This is best seen in the building's
                        'student street', an interior passage, dotted with nooks and crannies, that twists and meanders
                        through the complex and is open 24 hours a day. Cafés and lounges are interspersed with work
                        desks and whiteboards, and there is free internet access everywhere. Students, teachers and
                        visitors are studying, chatting, napping, emailing, researching, and reading. Every bit of this
                        space can instantaneously become the venue for a seminar, a snack or a friendship.</p>
                    <p>The fact that people are no longer tied to specific places for functions such as studying or
                        learning means that since the turn of the 21st century there has been a huge drop in demand for
                        traditional, private, enclosed spaces such as offices or classrooms. Simultaneously there has
                        been a tremendous rise in demand for semi-public spaces that can be informally appropriated as
                        ad-hoc work-spaces. This shift marks the biggest change in architecture in the 21st century. In
                        the previous century, architecture was about specialised structures — offices for working,
                        cafeterias for eating and so forth. This was necessary because workers needed to be near
                        landline phones, fax machines and filing cabinets, and because the economics of building
                        materials favoured repetitive and simple structures, such as grid patterns and cubicles.</p>
                    <p>With spaces made intentionally multi-functional, 21st-century aesthetics will probably be the
                        exact opposite of the sci-fi chic that 20th-century futurists once imagined. For example,
                        buildings will have much more varied shapes than before. People working on laptops find it
                        comforting to have their backs to a wall, so hybrid spaces will become curvier and snake-like in
                        order to make best use of the surface area of their inner walls. This is more affordable today
                        because computer-aided design and new materials make non-repetitive forms cheaper to build.</p>
                    <p>Flexibility is what separates today's successful spaces from unsuccessful ones. For example, a
                        not-for-profit organisation in New York turned Bryant Park, a once-derelict but charming garden
                        in front of the city's public library, into a hybrid-space park popular with office workers. The
                        park's manager noticed that a lot of visitors were using mobile phones and laptops there, so
                        they installed Wi-Fi and added some chairs and desks. The idea was not to distract people from
                        the flowers but to let them use their little bit of park as they saw fit.</p>
                    <p>The academic name for such spaces is 'third places', a term coined by the sociologist Ray
                        Oldenburg in 1989. Oldenburg wanted to distinguish between the sociological functions of
                        people's first places where they live, their second places where they work and the other public
                        spaces that serve them as safe, neutral and informal meeting points which would encourage
                        conversation. As Oldenburg saw it, a good third place makes admission free or cheap—the price of
                        a cup of coffee, say—offers creature comforts, and draws a group of regulars. He felt that most
                        people, especially in suburban areas, were moving only between first and second places. Society,
                        Oldenburg feared, was at risk of coming unstuck in these areas without third place venues for
                        spreading ideas and forming bonds.</p>
                    <p>But, do the oasis-like internet cafés for urban nomads play the role that Oldenburg envisioned?
                        James Katz of Rutgers University warns that these cafés are often full of people with headphones
                        on, speaking on their mobile phones and hacking away at their laptop keyboards. They are more
                        engaged with their email inbox than with the people touching their elbows. These places are
                        'physically inhabited but psychologically evacuated', says Katz, which leaves people feeling
                        'more isolated than they would be if the café were merely empty'. Many cafés are trying to deal
                        with this problem by, for example, hosting special events such as live jazz and poetry readings
                        and actually turning off their internet connections at this time so that people mingle more.
                        Clearly the new oases and the urban nomads who spawned them are still evolving.</p>
